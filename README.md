## Reflection
This was a project I created in order get started in learning about web development. This was my first experience creating a web app and using the tools/technologies listed above.

I started with minimal knowledge using javascript and throughout the project I taught myself how to create component-based, responsive pages on the front-end using React.js as well as a server-side api to handle requests using Node.js and Express.js. I also learned about CRUD operations and incorporated them into the project through the creation of new posts and updating likes/comments.
